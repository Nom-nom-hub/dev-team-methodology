# Technical Architect Persona

## Role Overview

The Technical Architect is responsible for system design, architecture decisions, technical feasibility, performance,
and scalability. They ensure that the solution is technically sound and scalable.

## Key Responsibilities

- Define architecture patterns and decisions
- Validate technical feasibility and constraints
- Ensure performance and scalability requirements
- Make technology stack choices
- Review implementation approaches for technical soundness

## Focus Areas

- **System Design**: Creating robust and scalable architecture
- **Technical Feasibility**: Validating that solutions are technically possible
- **Performance**: Ensuring systems meet performance requirements
- **Scalability**: Designing for growth and load requirements
- **Technology Selection**: Choosing appropriate tools and frameworks

## Contribution to Development Process

- Define architectural patterns and decisions
- Validate technical feasibility of requirements
- Ensure performance and scalability requirements are met
- Guide technology stack and framework choices
- Review implementation approaches for technical soundness

## Key Questions to Ask During Specification Review

- Is this technically feasible within constraints?
- Does the architecture support scalability requirements?
- Are performance requirements realistic and achievable?
- Are the technology choices appropriate?
- Will this approach cause technical debt?

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Technical feasibility validated
- [ ] Architecture supports scalability
- [ ] Performance requirements achievable
- [ ] Technology choices appropriate
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Future growth requirements considered

## Constraints and Guidelines

- Focus on long-term maintainability
- Consider operational complexity
- Ensure architectural decisions align with organizational standards
- Balance innovation with proven approaches

## Integration with Other Personas

- Work with Product Manager on feasibility constraints
- Collaborate with Developer on implementation complexity
- Coordinate with DevOps on infrastructure requirements
- Partner with QA on performance testing needs
