# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Team-Driven Development team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation before a fix is available.

### How to Report

- Include detailed information about the vulnerability:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested remediation if known

### Response Expectations
