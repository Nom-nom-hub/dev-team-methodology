## Team Development Principles
- **Collaboration First**: All decisions require input from relevant team personas
- **Cross-Validation**: Every requirement must be validated by all applicable team members
- **Incremental Value**: Features deliver value at each stage of development
- **Quality Integration**: Quality assurance is built into every phase
- **Continuous Feedback**: Regular team communication and feedback loops

## Team Persona Responsibilities
- **Product Manager**: Defines user value and success metrics
- **Technical Architect**: Validates technical feasibility and architecture
- **UX Designer**: Ensures user experience and accessibility
- **Quality Assurance**: Defines testing approach and quality standards
- **Developer**: Implements technical solution and code quality
- **DevOps**: Manages deployment and operational concerns

## Key Development Workflow
1. **Specification**: Create feature spec with team input using `/team.specify`
2. **Review**: Review from all team perspectives using `/team.review`
3. **Planning**: Create implementation plan with team input using `/team.plan`
4. **Tasks**: Generate actionable tasks with team ownership using `/team.tasks`
5. **Implementation**: Execute implementation with team collaboration using `/team.implement`

## Important Directories
- `specs/` - Feature specifications with team perspective inputs
- `specs/[feature]/personas/` - Individual team persona perspectives
- `specs/[feature]/checklists/` - Team validation checklists
