## Task Completion Requirements

### What "Done" Means

**Research & Design Tasks:**

- Research findings documented in research.md with actual results
- Design artifacts created (architecture diagrams, specifications, etc.)
- Team validation completed with all stakeholder sign-offs

**Implementation Tasks:**

- Code files created and committed to the feature branch
- Implementation follows the agreed architecture and patterns
- Code is functional (tested locally or in unit tests)
- Code follows team standards and quality guidelines

**Testing Tasks:**

- Test code files created (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- Tests execute against implementations
- Test results documented with pass/fail status
- Issues found are tracked and addressed

**Deployment Tasks:**

- Deployment artifacts created (packages, configurations, etc.)
- Deployment process tested and validated
- Operational requirements met and documented

### What is NOT "Done"

- ✗ Writing a plan to do the work
- ✗ Creating implementation logs that describe what will be done
- ✗ Documenting tasks without completing them
- ✗ Planning a research task without researching
- ✗ Writing a code outline without actual code
- ✗ Describing tests without writing test code

### Task Status Meanings

- **To Do**: Work has not started
- **In Progress**: Active work is underway with deliverables being created
- **Done**: Work is complete with deliverables created and validated
